<bring to emotional connection> 

timemanagment with work and pressure to finish homeworks, getting no sleep, //?working in a group=interpersonal conflicts? 

!intro "^I'm going ^ to wrap up #| I would bet... # we've all had issues to work on #| ...#within^ the groups|...^within our # personal lives|....^our timemanagement skills|
	...^juggling work| ...|and life's ^ suprizes #...which seem to tend to appear when we're the most stressed...|we all decided to take this class and add to that...
	I know for me...sleep has become an old friend I wish I could see more of...and this project hasn't allieviated my feelings about that at all" 

!intro "...during this project I started to think about this class... and code, as a puzzle^... |this class is about solving problems...^ kind of like a puzzle,^ right? 

!intro "...|and it isn't about being perfect...^ I think its more about being able to tackle issues| ^and work through them... like that puzzle...I wanted to find the place my piece fit which was most beneficial to our team dynamic"

//personal problems
<bring back to page work>

!prpb "^I found my place to be more about bug fixing | ^ and troubleshooting errors with jonathan | on backend ^ hes a wiz # and I'm not in the same place"|

//lighter note
! "^I began # to think of myself as a rubber duck... [!QUACK] `silly antics`"

!prpb #"I had to read through group members code | and I ^ realized that there were holes in my understanding...| and ^ I had to take the time to go backwards to relearn and work through them|"

!prpb "Other problems I recognized in my own ability....My typing skills aren't as profienct as I'd Like them to be"


!prpb "^working by oneself is easier |# but ^working with a team can be stressful | *life happens*"#

!prpb "we can all probably relate to thinking we know nothing...these are tough concepts to grasp especially at the rate we are working"

?time reading through group code?

<what i worked on>


FIREBASE PENTESTING	-> firebase security -> packet sniffed hash password decode -> scrapped email, phone number, profile picture <?tyler too?> removing from public asap 

!code "we used firebase AUTH having to trouble shoot the code on a new concept"

!code  "While troubleshooting, I noticed that our google information was being stored locally...and having experience on the darker side of the internet it didn't sit right with me"
	
	-> low commits due to problems with git hub commits -> learning git commands ~ rebase, ?merge conficts?, BRANCH CONTROL,
 
        -> finding api and connection.js //reorder for speech coherency
	-> redirect using AJAX then jon's one line of code 

%% 
<if time then go on>
//more issues
	-> bug finding and debugger use ~ pass file location in .vscode/lauch.json ~ add breakpoints ~ DEBUG!
	-> conflicts with file structure/management
